Memorandum 

To:  Acting  Area  Manager 

From:  NRS/Archaeologist 
 

Subject:  History  of  elephant  find  and  emergency  excavation  of 
same 

On  November  20,  1990  archaeologist  Don  Simonin  of  the  Kingman 
Resource  Area,  Phoenix  District informed  me  by  telephone  that  a 
student  in  his  community  college  archaeology  class  told  him  that 
one  of  his  gem  and  mineral  society  friends  had  discovered  and 
partially  excavated  a  mammoth.  Don  made  contact  Hitl1  these 
individuals  through  his  student  and  paid  a  visit  to  the  field 
location.  Simonis  indicated  that  the  individual  tl1at  found  and 
partially  excavated  the  mammoth  was  Dave  Gor!..lcn  .  Mr  Gordon  is  a 
member  of  the  Lake  Hnvasu  Gem  and  Mineral Society. 
 

 
Both  surface  and subsurface  are  federally  administered  by  BLM. 


Both  Mike  Ford,  prior  Area  Manager,  and  I  have  given  talks  to  the 
Society  and  in  particular  in  regard  to  the  regulations  pertaining 
gem  and  fossil  collection. 
newspaper  article  identified  George  Hunter  and  Dave  Gordon  as  the 
finders  and  excavators  of  a  mammoth  some  35  miles  nu1  th  of  Lake 
Havasu  City  (Today  News,  Wednesday,  Volume  8  NumbeJ:  14,  February 
1,  1989,  page  1  and  3  enclosed).  Both  Mike  Ford  an0  I  gave  talks 
to  members  of  the  Lake  Hu.vasu  Gem  and  Mineral  Society  prior  to  or 
following  this  newspaper  article.  Both  Hunter  and  Gotdon  were 
aware  of  regulations  pe~:taining  to  fossil  collection  from  theoe 
talks. 
In  genera 1 ,  Soci ely  members  fe 1 t  that  the  regulations 
were  unfair  and  restricted  their  freedom  to  hobby  collect  any 
where  they  chose  and  especially  on  federally  administered  lands. 
For  this  reason  the re  has  been  tension  between  the  society  and 
our  office.  To  my  lmowledge  there  was  no  attempt:  to  contact  our(cid:173)
office  about  the  mammoth  find  or  to  determine  the  ot-1n0rship  of 
the  find  spot.  However,  the  finders  did  contact  the  University 
of  nrizona  fo r 
i n formation  and  evaluation  of  their  fi11d,  as  ~er 
the  newspaper  arti.c l e. 

I  inspected  the  fi nd  location  on  November  26,  1990 

 

 

 

I  estimated  that  th e  mammoth  \-las 

probably  20,000  yea r s  old  based  on  its  geologic  position  in  a 
Colorado  River  flood  silt  unit.  Don  Simonis  had  made  contact 
with  Doctors  Larry  l\.genbroad  and  Jim  Meu.d  of  Nor-thern  At~ i zona 
University  in  rega 1~d  to  this  find. 
n  field  visit  u] t.h  these 
individuals  Has  made  on  December  5,  1990.

At  the  December  5,  1990  field  meeting  the  mmnmnth  Han  f"'}t~tm:iued  by 
Agenbroad  and  Mead  Hho  concluded  that  a  large  portion  of  the 
mammoth  appeared  to  be  intact  and  was  worthy  of  controlled 
excavation  using  a  combination  of  archaeological  and 
paleontological  approaches,  as  there  is  the  possibility  of 
cultural  association  in  the  form  of  either  bone  or  stone 
artifacts.  Doctors  Agenbroad  and  Mead  agreed  to  supply  graduate 
student  labor  from  their  classes  with  work  to  begin  on  December 
13  with  a  completio11  date  on  December  16,  1990. 
that  exposure,  stabilization,  and  removal  could  be  accomplinhed 
in  this  time  frame.  It  was  agreed  by  all  present  that.  the  rna~r~rnoth

In  terms  of  the  info1nmt.ion  contained  in  the  n ewnpapP r  nrlicJc 
about  Dave  Gordon  and  George  Hunter  excavating  the  mammoth,  there 
are  a  number  of  itews  to  consider.  They  made  no  att empt  to 
contact  BLM  about  land  OHnership,  did  not  apply  for  a  permit,  did 
not  work  with  BLM  to  excavate  the  mammoth,  and  as  I  ur~t]crntand  it 
have  kept  a  number  of  the  bones.  One  second  hand  comme nt  Has 
that  the  tooth  shown  in  the  article  had  been  sold  to  nomeone  in 
Japan.  We  need  to  work  with  these  indiviJuals  but  n<Jt  absolve 
them  of  unlawful  actions.  As  we  find  out  mo1  (·  about  t.he  location 
of  the  held  bones  He  :Jhould  write  each  of  tltP  individ uals 
involved  and  request  Lhe  1·etur11  this  government  prop e rty  citing 
regulations  in  suppot t  of  this  request. 
T..a\-1  enforceme n t  n cU on 
and  further  investigation  may  be  initiated  in  some  form  if  the 
bones  are  not  returned.  He  need  to  be  :::;t.et:n  but  not  ~ :tto n g
